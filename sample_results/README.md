# Sample Results

This directory contains sample output files generated by the Text Mining Tool. These files serve as examples of the types of results you can expect when using the tool.

## Sample Files

- `processed_text.json`: JSON file containing processed text data, including tokens and sentences
- `sentiment_analysis.json`: Results of sentiment analysis
- `named_entities.json`: Extracted named entities
- `keywords.json`: Extracted keywords
- `topics.json`: Results of topic modeling
- `summary.txt`: Text summary

## Generating Your Own Results

To generate your own results, run the example scripts in the [examples](../examples) directory:

```bash
# Basic usage example
python examples/basic_usage.py

# Advanced usage example
python examples/advanced_usage.py
```

Your results will be saved to this directory by default. You can specify a different output directory using the `--output` parameter:

```bash
python examples/basic_usage.py --output my_results
```
