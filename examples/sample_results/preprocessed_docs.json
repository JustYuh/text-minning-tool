    "original": "Text mining, also known as text data mining, is the process of transforming unstructured text into a structured format\nto identify meaningful patterns and new insights. By applying advanced analytical techniques, text mining helps\norganizations find valuable business intelligence that might otherwise remain undiscovered within their unstructured data.\n\nText mining uses natural language processing (NLP), machine learning, and statistical methods to extract and analyze\ninformation from text sources. These sources can include emails, social media posts, customer reviews, survey responses,\narticles, and other documents. The goal is to discover hidden patterns, trends, and relationships that can inform\ndecision-making and strategy.\n\nCommon text mining tasks include:\n\n1. Information Extraction: Identifying and extracting specific pieces of information from text, such as names, dates,\n   locations, and events.\n\n2. Text Categorization: Automatically assigning predefined categories or tags to text documents based on their content.\n\n3. Sentiment Analysis: Determining the emotional tone or attitude expressed in text, often categorized as positive,\n   negative, or neutral.\n\n4. Topic Modeling: Discovering abstract topics or themes that occur in a collection of documents.\n\n5. Named Entity Recognition: Identifying and classifying named entities in text into predefined categories like person\n   names, organizations, locations, etc.\n\n6. Relationship Extraction: Identifying relationships between entities mentioned in text.\n\nText mining has applications across various industries, including healthcare, finance, marketing, customer service,\nand research. For example, healthcare organizations might use text mining to analyze patient records and identify\ntrends in symptoms or treatment outcomes. Marketing teams might analyze social media posts to understand customer\nsentiment about their products or services.\n\nAs the volume of unstructured text data continues to grow exponentially, text mining becomes increasingly valuable\nfor organizations seeking to gain insights and competitive advantages from their data assets.
